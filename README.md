# Description
The pico y placa predictor is a small program written in Python that "predicts" whether a car will be able to circulate on the streets within a user-specified date and time. This taken of the following measures imposed by the ATM (Agencia Nacional de Tr√°nsito del Ecuador):

Vehicles with plates 1 and 2 will not be able to circulate on Mondays, vehicles with plates 3 and 4 will not be able to circulate on Tuesdays, vehicles with plates 5 and 6 will not be able to circulate on Wednesdays, those with plates 7 and 8 on Thursdays and those with plates 9 and 0 will not be allowed on Fridays, from 07:00 am to 09:30 am and from 16:00 am to 19:30 pm.

# Observations
The Car class inside car.py, has all the logical methods of the program. The class is composed by three attributes (license_plate, date and time), and depending of the inputs from the main.py, a specific output is presented. Also in days.py, are the methods to convert the date input from string to date object and then get the day in string.

# Program execution
The program starts with the main.py file, using the command ***py main.py***
